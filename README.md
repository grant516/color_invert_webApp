# Overview

I built a simple web app to help me learn the basics of building web apps.

The purpose of the software I built is to allow the user to enter a RGB value and receive the inverted colors. This is done by displaying both colors on the screen.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Future Work

* I would like to make it so one half of the screen is one color and the other is the inverted color
